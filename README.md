# `ptrace` example

This Linux `ptrace` example spawns a child process and manipulates it to run to completion. Otherwise, the child process will continue forever (until it's killed).

`ptrace` is used by utilites like `strace` as well as debuggers like `gdb` and `lldb`, which run as their own processes but spawn the target executable as a child process.

The disassemblies were generated by running `objdump -d child > <arch>dump.txt` on an x86-64 machine and an arm64 machine.

Note: while macOS does defines the `ptrace` function, it's pretty much useless. Other functions like `task_for_pid` and `thread_get_state` are better suited for this role.
